I decided to write this code after reading book about Design Patterns in Java. Application is not ready yet.

I will be very thankful for code review, feedback or some suggestions on lukasz.usarz@softarea.pl


## To run application:
mvn clean package exec:java


## Controls:
* a - move left
* d - move right
* s - move down

* o - rotate left
* p - rotate right
